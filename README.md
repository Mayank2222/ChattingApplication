# INTRODUCTION 

➤ Chatting Application is a desktop-based application. 

➤ This client-server chat application is based on Java Swing and uses a socket package. it is simple and easy and requires only core Java knowledge.

➤ This application/program is a good example of using java.io, and java.net packages to create a chat application. 

➤ Chatting is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas “together” despite geographical barriers. 

➤ The technology has been available for years but the acceptance of it was quite recent.

# REQUIREMENTS

➱ External Interface Requirements

➱ User Interface 

The user interface required to be developed for the system should be user-friendly and attractive.
There are two sets of Java APIs for graphics programming: 
               AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) and Swing.

AWT API was introduced in JDK 1.0. Most of the AWT components have become obsolete and should be replaced by newer Swing components.

Swing API, a much more comprehensive set of graphics libraries that enhances the AWT, was introduced as part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) after the release of JDK 1.1. JFC consists of Swing, Java2D, Accessibility, Internationalization, and Pluggable Look-and-Feel Support APIs. JFC was an add-on to JDK 1.1 but has been integrated into core Java since JDK 1.2.
